    "In its purest sense, science describes both the simple hypothesize–test–revise method at its heart and the accrued body of knowledge obtained thereby:  sharp at the center, fuzzy at the edges.  Computation and modeling fits into this cycle by allowing models to be generated and tested against empirical natural results as well as in cases where no physical results are attainable.\n",

    "Although most scientific code is written in Fortran or C/C++, Python has rapidly become a serious and viable contender as a complete scientific computing language, particular in competition with MATLAB.  The packages discussed in this notebook, NumPy and SciPy, are the current enablers of that prowess.  As much of their underlying features take advantage of compiled C libraries, their performance is comparable to traditional compiled languages, yet they retain the dynamic flexibility of Python.\n",
