    "Formally, an exception is an event raised to indicate that a function has failed.  Most of the time, this means that the function was passed bad data, or it encountered a situation it can't handle, or just reached a known invalid result, like division by zero.  (However, this may also be intentional—Python causes a container to raise a `StopIteration` exception to signal that there are no items left to iterate over, for instance in a `for` loop.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Common exceptions include:\n",
    "- `SyntaxError` — check missing colons or parentheses\n",
    "- `NameError` — check for typos, function definitions\n",
    "- `TypeError` — check variable types (coerce if necessary)\n",
    "- `ValueError` — check function parameters\n",
    "- `IOError` — check that files exist\n",
    "- `IndexError` — don't reference nonexistent list elements\n",
    "- `KeyError` — similar to an IndexError, but for dictionaries\n",
    "- `ZeroDivisionError` — three guesses...\n",
    "- `IndentationError` — check that spaces and tabs aren't mixed\n",
    "- `Exception` — generic error category\n",
